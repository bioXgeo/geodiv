## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORS.

There was 1 NOTE: 

"Uses the superseded package: snow." We use 'parallel' for all parallel operations, but 'parallel' depends on 'snow for some functions. We now include 'snow' because a user reported that it showed up as a warning during installation.

There is 1 WARNING.

   Package was archived on CRAN
   
   CRAN repository db overrides:
     X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2021-07-29 for repeated policy violation.

The package was archived due to the download.file argument in the vignette not failing gracefully. The line in the vignette is now in a tryCatch function, which will produce a clean error message if the download doesn't work. We believe that this makes the package suitable for CRAN again.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
